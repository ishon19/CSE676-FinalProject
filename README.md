# Deep Learning (CSE-676) Spring 2022 Group Project 

## Introduction
This is the repo for the Deep Learning group project. We have implemented <a href="https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix" target="_blank">Pix2Pix</a> conditional adversarial network using Pytorch and have used different datasets to test and validate our implementation, details mentioned below.

## Setup 
For running the project locally, we need following 
* Python
* Installed instance of [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (optional, but essential for training huge datasets requiring more compute)

## Getting Started
Once we have the core pre-requisites for running the project done, we can move to the next part, that is, downloading the datasets and making them available locally for testing
